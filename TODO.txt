Interface Web:

* Right Click on Project:
  * "Create New File" -> "Create New Module"
    * Check if a suffix .ml is provided, otherwise, add it
    * When a module is added, it should be put in the command line to
        compile
    * Would it be possible to reorder the files from the list, by copy-move

* For all forms:
   * No default
   * Give an example, instead, or rules (no spaces, etc...)
   * Maybe a link to documentation

* Message d'accueil -> Help

* Instead of the toplevel:
   * Copy selection to clipboard
   * Button "execute clipboard" in Try-OCaml

* Add a div to ace-edit.html, so that the editor can insert itself in
   that div instead of at the beginning of the page.
